Difference between == and equals method in java

1. == is an operator where as equals() is a method of Object class.

2. == operator compares reference or memory location of objects in the heap, whether they point to the same location or not. 
Whenever we create an object using the operator new it will create a new memory location for that object. 
So we use the == operator to check memory location or address of two objects are the same or not.
equals() method  is used to compare the state of two objects or the contents of the objects.

3. Equals method can be overridden but you can’t override behavior of “==” operator
